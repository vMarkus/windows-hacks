swapping out hdd to ssd usually requires AHCI support, just changing it in bios leads to "no operating system found"
workaround:

open regedit as administrator
navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\storahci\StartOverride
set "0" REG_DWORD to 0 (from 3 or other)
reboot, go to bios, edit AHCI from disabled to enabled
Windows 8/8.1/10 should boot now
